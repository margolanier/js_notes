Objects let us combine related info into a single name

1.	Arrays have multiple parts, each **element** identified by an index
2.	Objects have multiple parts, each **property** identified by a string (like css)

	let song = {
		name = 'My Heart Will Go On',
		artist = 'Celine Dion',
		year = '1996',
		favorite = true,
	};

	console.log(song.name); // dot notation

function has parameters functionName() {}
object is being set to a value objectName = {}
