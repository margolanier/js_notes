# Internet

## Frontend & Backend
Frontend - users download code from the server  
code is running on the user's computer (server just hosts it)

Backend - raw data, centralized info (emails, weather in charlotte)

IP address = 'street address for mail'
each device has it's own IP 

	ifconfig

DNS (domain name system)- maps domain/url to IP address
